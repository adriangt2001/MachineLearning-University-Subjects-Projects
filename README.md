## Description

This repo contains the 2 projects I did for the Machine Learning subject at University.

## [Practica](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/tree/main/Practica)

This folder contains the first project of the subject using the [titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), where the target is to predict whether a passager survived or not. I did this project with [Setset19](https://github.com/NIU1635219) and [Jacotet](https://github.com/1631153).  

Inside the folder you can find the following files:  

+ [titanic](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/tree/main/Practica/titanic). The Kaggle Dataset used for this project. Contains a train.csv, test.csv and gender_submission.csv, which is a premade demo prediction from the Kaggle official site.  
+ [APC_Practica_1_2023.ipynb](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/Practica/APC_Practica_1_2023.ipynb). This is the Jupyter Notebook used to preprocess the data, train and evaluate the ML models and to test them on the test set.  
+ [submission.csv](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/Practica/submission.csv). To be honest, I don't remember what is this. However looks very similar to the gender_submission.csv, so it may be a copy from that file.
+ [titanic.zip](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/Practica/titanic.zip). The same as the titanic folder but in a zip file. This is the original download from Kaggle.

## [CasKaggle](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/tree/main/CasKaggle)  

This folder contains the second project of the subject using the [Top Spotify songs from 2010-2019 - BY YEAR dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year). I chose to try to predict the year where the song was most likely published, so this was a multiclass classification problem. As this wasn't a team project, so I did it alone.  

+ [Cas_Kaggle_Codi-1568249.ipynb](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/CasKaggle/Cas_Kaggle_Codi-1568249.ipynb). This is the Jupyter Notebook used to preprocess the data, train and evaluate the ML models and to test them on the test set.  
+ [Cas_Kaggle_CodiDataset-1568249.zip](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/CasKaggle/Cas_Kaggle_CodiDataset-1568249.zip). A zip file containing both the Jupyter Notebook and the dataset used.  
+ [Cas_Kaggle_Memoria-1568249.docx](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/CasKaggle/Cas_Kaggle_Memoria-1568249.docx). The editable file of the final report.
+ [Cas_Kaggle_Memoria-1568249.pdf](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/CasKaggle/Cas_Kaggle_Memoria-1568249.pdf). The final report.
+ [Cas_Kaggle_Presentacio-1568249.pdf](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/CasKaggle/Cas_Kaggle_Presentacio-1568249.pdf). The short presentation I did at the end of the project in pdf format.
+ [Cas_Kaggle_Presentacio-1568249.pptx](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/CasKaggle/Cas_Kaggle_Presentacio-1568249.pptx). The short presentation I did at the end of the project.
+ [archive.zip](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/CasKaggle/archive.zip). A zip file containing the top10s.csv dataset. This is the original download from Kaggle.
+ [top10s.csv](https://github.com/adriangt2001/MachineLearning-University-Subjects-Projects/blob/main/CasKaggle/top10s.csv). The Kaggle Dataset used for this project.


### HAVE A GREAT DAY <3
